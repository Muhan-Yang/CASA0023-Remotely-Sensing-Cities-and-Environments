    "text": "1.1 Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEY ASPECT\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\nDefinitions\nRemote sensing as a technique for collecting Earth’s surface information from a distance.\n\n\nPlatforms\nSatellites, planes, drones (“spectroradiometer”in a lab or in the field)used for data acquisition.\n\n\nSensor Types\nPassive and active sensors, their principles and examples.\n\n\nElectromagnetic Radiation\nInteraction with Earth’s surface and atmosphere.\n\n\nData Formats\nFocus on raster data and its applications.\n\n\nResolutions\nSpatial, spectral, temporal, radiometric resolutions in remote sensing.\n\n\nApplications\nLand cover, agriculture, climate change, disaster management.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Definitions\nNASA defines remote sensing as the process of acquiring information from a distance, commonly associated with Earth Observation (EO), utilizing sensors on platforms like satellites, drones, and more. Currently, over 150 satellites equipped with these sensors orbit Earth, collecting essential data. However, the proliferation of space technology has led to a challenge with space debris, with NASA tracking over 27,000 pieces, underscoring the need for strategies to manage and mitigate space pollution.\n\n\n1.1.2 Platforms\nRemote sensing is accomplished using sensors mounted on various platforms, each offering unique capabilities for data collection from the Earth’s surface, atmosphere, and oceans:\n\nSatellites: Capable of systematically covering vast areas, satellites revisit the same points on Earth from daily to every 16 days. This regular observation schedule is crucial for tracking environmental changes, weather patterns, and monitoring natural disasters on a global scale.\nPlanes (aerial imagery): Provide targeted, high-resolution imagery for specific areas, making them invaluable for detailed surveys, agricultural assessments, and environmental monitoring.\nDrones: Offer unparalleled flexibility and precision, capturing detailed data at low altitudes for applications such as precision agriculture, construction monitoring, and environmental conservation.\nPhones: Enable widespread, citizen-driven data collection, contributing to urban studies, crowd-sourced mapping projects, and local environmental observations.\nFree standing on the ground or sea (with handheld devices): Ground and maritime platforms, like tripods, buoys, and hand-held devices, allow for direct, in-situ measurements of soil, water, and atmospheric conditions, essential for localized research and monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious platforms and sensors used for remote sensing   Source: Toth (2018)\n\n\n1.1.3 Sensor Types\nRemote sensing sensors are broadly classified into two categories based on their operational principles: passive and active sensors.\n\nPassive Sensors: Capture energy naturally reflected or emitted by objects, relying on sunlight as the primary light source. Examples include cameras and satellite sensors, ideal for environmental monitoring and Earth observation during daylight hours.\nActive Sensors: Generate their own energy to illuminate targets, measuring the reflected energy. Technologies like LiDAR and radar fall into this category, enabling detailed surface mapping and atmospheric studies, regardless of day or night conditions.\n\nChoosing between passive and active sensors depends on the project’s goals, like desired detail, target area conditions, and when data is collected. While passive sensors excel in natural light conditions, active sensors offer versatility in challenging environments (e.g., night-time or cloud-covered areas). For example, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) excels in overcoming challenges posed by clouds, volcanic ash, and darkness, thanks to its ability to operate at longer wavelengths across different bands (e.g., P, L, S, C, X, Ku, K). This versatility enhances Earth observation capabilities, enabling data acquisition in nearly all weather and lighting conditions.\n\n\n1.1.4 Electromagnetic Radiation\nElectromagnetic radiation (EMR) is essential for remote sensing, acting as the medium that carries information from the Earth’s surface to sensors located on satellites, aircraft, or ground-based platforms. EMR encompasses a spectrum of wavelengths, including visible light, infrared, and microwaves, each interacting uniquely with different surface materials and atmospheric conditions.\nFundamental Principles:\n\nWavelength (λ): The distance between consecutive wave peaks, determining the radiation’s energy and type.\nFrequency (ν): The number of wave cycles per second, inversely related to wavelength (λ=c/ν), where c is the speed of light (3×10⁸ m/s)\n\nEMR propagates through space, carrying energy with oscillating electric and magnetic fields at right angles to each other and the direction of travel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do electromagnetic waves wave   Source: imathworks.com\nInteraction with Earth’s Surface:\nThe interaction of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with the Earth’s surface—encompassing reflection, absorption, transmission and scattering—fundamentally shapes the data captured by remote sensing technologies. Reflective properties reveal surface textures and compositions, absorption characteristics inform on material types and conditions, and transmission data offers insights into the substance’s transparency to specific EMR wavelengths.\nAtmospheric Influence:\nWhile traversing the atmosphere, EMR may be scattered by particles or absorbed by gases, altering its path and intensity before reaching the surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic radiations’ interactions with Earth’s surface and atmosphere   Source: Deepak Kumar Soni (2013)\nScattering Phenomena:\n\nRayleigh Scattering: Predominant when atmospheric particles are significantly smaller than the radiation’s wavelength, primarily affecting shorter wavelengths and coloring the sky blue.\nMie Scattering: Arises when particle sizes are comparable to the wavelength, altering all wavelengths somewhat uniformly, noticeable during light’s passage through atmospheric pollutants or moisture.\nNon-selective Scattering: Manifests when particles exceed the radiation’s wavelength in size, impacting all wavelengths alike and contributing to clouds’ white appearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of visible wavelengths   Source: vertebratepest.wordpress.com\nInfluence on Visual Perception:\nBlue light scatters more intensely in Earth’s atmosphere due to its shorter wavelength, creating a blue sky and vivid sunsets with red and orange hues as the sun’s rays travel through more atmosphere. In contrast, the Moon’s lack of atmosphere results in a black sky and challenges in distance perception due to no scattering, while the ocean’s blue color arises from the absorption of longer wavelengths and scattering of shorter blue wavelengths, deepening in hue with increased depth.\nSpecular Reflection VS Diffuse Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecular and diffuse reflection Source: Tempfli, K. et al. (2009)\n\nSpecular Reflection occurs on smooth surfaces (like water or polished rocks), where light reflects in a single, specific direction. This reflection is directional, causing bright spots in images if the angle aligns with the sensor.\nDiffuse Reflection happens on rough surfaces (such as soil or vegetation), scattering light in multiple directions. This reflection is uniform, providing consistent information regardless of the viewing angle.\nImpact on Remote Sensing: The main difference is how they affect image brightness and information consistency. Specular reflection can vary with observer angle, leading to potential bright spots. Diffuse reflection offers reliable data about the Earth’s surface, useful for applications like vegetation monitoring or land cover classification.\n\nIn the forthcoming studies, by exploring phenomena such as the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), polarization, and fluorescence, we will gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of electromagnetic radiation’s interaction with the Earth’s surface...\n\n\n1.1.5 Data Formats\nRemote sensing data primarily uses raster formats, organizing the Earth’s surface into pixels, each representing specific information like reflectance or temperature. Key raster data formats include:\n\nBand Interleaved by Line (BIL): Facilitates line-by-line analysis across multiple bands.\nBand Sequential (BSQ): Groups all pixels of a band together, suitable for single-band processing.\nBand Interleaved by Pixel (BIP): Stores all band values for each pixel together, ideal for multi-spectral analysis.\n\nVidero: Organizing Multi-band Image Data (BIL,BIP and BSQ Formats)\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoTIFF: The most common format, incorporating geographic metadata, and widely supported across GIS and remote sensing platforms.\nLiDAR data: Capturing 3D point information, illustrates the adaptability of these formats for specific applications like elevation modeling.\n\n\n\n1.1.6 Resolutions\nIn remote sensing, data quality and applicability are determined by four key resolutions: spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric. Each plays a crucial role in how Earth observation data is captured, analyzed, and utilized.\nSpatial Resolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: gisgeography.com\nSpatial resolution refers to the size of one pixel in a raster image, which can range from as fine as 10 cm to several kilometers. It determines the smallest object that can be detected on the Earth’s surface, with higher resolutions providing more detail.\nSpectral Resolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: gisgeography.com\nSpectral resolution describes the ability of a sensor to define wavelength intervals or bands. It ranges from broad bands capturing basic color information in the visible spectrum to narrow bands that can identify specific spectral signatures of materials. Spectral signatures are unique to each feature on Earth but are limited by atmospheric windows that allow only certain wavelengths to pass through unabsorbed.\nTemporal Resolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: gisgeography.com\nTemporal resolution is about the frequency at which a sensor revisits the same location, which can vary from multiple times a day to once every few weeks. This is vital for monitoring changes over time, such as vegetation growth, urban development, or the progression of natural disasters.\nRadiometric Resolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: USGS\nRadiometric resolution indicates a sensor’s sensitivity to detect slight differences in light or reflectance levels, essentially the range of possible values a sensor can record. This can vary from 256 levels (8-bit) to over 2048 levels (11-bit), affecting the sensor’s ability to distinguish between similar surfaces.\nEach type of resolution has its balancing act, influenced by the sensor’s design and the orbit type, whether geosynchronous or geostationary. The choice of sensor and its resolutions is dictated by the specific needs of a project, including the size of features to be observed, the date range of interest, revisit requirements, spectral sensitivity, and budget constraints. Understanding these resolutions is essential for selecting the appropriate remote sensing technology to answer specific scientific, environmental, or planning questions."

    "section": "1.2 Applications",
    "text": "1.2 Applications\nIn the practical section, we learned how to download and process Sentinel and Landsat satellite data, and analyzed the downloaded data using QGIS, SNAP, and R software.\n\n1.2.1 SNAP\nSNAP (Sentinels Application Platform) is a free and open-source software platform developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) designed to provide comprehensive support for processing and analyzing data from the Sentinel satellite series. This platform is specifically aimed at earth observation data, offering a wide array of tools for the preprocessing, analysis, and visualization of remote sensing data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe platform includes a series of toolboxes, each targeting specific data processing tasks such as image correction, classification, image synthesis, and change detection. These toolboxes offer a broad range of algorithms that enable users to perform complex analyses and interpretations of remote sensing data.\n\n\n1.2.2 Sentinel\nThe Sentinel satellites are part of the Copernicus program, a cornerstone of the European Union’s efforts to monitor the Earth and its environment for the benefit of all European citizens. This fleet of satellites provides a unique set of observations, starting from high-resolution land and ocean monitoring (Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical sensors) to atmospheric composition (Sentinel-5P). Sentinel data is pivotal for a wide range of applications, including climate change, land use change detection, urban planning, and natural disaster assessment and management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNAP is particularly well-suited for processing Sentinel data. It offers specialized toolboxes for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3, among others, facilitating tasks such as radar interferometry, land cover classification, and water color monitoring. These capabilities are enhanced by SNAP’s ability to handle the large data volumes produced by the Sentinel fleet, providing efficient data access and processing tools that cater to both scientific research and operational monitoring needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Landsat\nWhile SNAP is primarily designed for Sentinel data, its flexibility and broad range of functionalities also make it useful for processing Landsat data, one of the longest-running sources of satellite imagery used for studying land changes over time. Landsat data complements Sentinel data by offering a historical perspective on land use and land cover changes, going back over four decades. This long-term dataset is invaluable for understanding environmental changes, assessing ecosystem health, and planning land management strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing SNAP for Landsat data involves leveraging its preprocessing, analysis, and visualization capabilities to manage Landsat’s multispectral imagery. Although SNAP does not include dedicated toolboxes for Landsat as it does for Sentinel satellites, its generic tools for raster data handling, image correction, and classification can be applied to Landsat images. This allows users to integrate Landsat data with Sentinel observations for comprehensive Earth observation analyses, offering a broader temporal and spectral range of environmental monitoring capabilities.\n\n\n1.2.4 Using R\nThe process involves exporting Sentinel and Landsat data from SNAP as GeoTIFFs and shapefiles, then analyzing these in R using packages like terra for direct pixel value extraction. Custom R functions facilitate efficient processing and statistical analysis of spectral signatures for different land cover types. The analysis culminates in visualizing spectral signatures through density plots and comparative graphs, leveraging R’s graphical capabilities for detailed environmental analysis. This streamlined approach in R enhances the flexibility and depth of spectral analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandomly selected various land use types in Cape Town for a comparative analysis of their spectral characteristics\nThis figure represents the distribution of the spectral response of different feature types, as well as their overlap, by means of shaded areas of different colours. This distribution can help us to identify and differentiate between the feature types. Through such analysis, we can better understand the spectral behaviour of each feature type, which in turn can be used for classification, monitoring and other surface analysis tasks.\n\n\n1.2.5 Practical Application of RS\n\nUrban Planning and Infrastructure Monitoring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote Sensing and GIS Data Fusion   Source:Talat Munshi (2013)\nUtilizing spatial resolution principles, high-resolution imagery enables precise urban layout mapping and infrastructure changes over time, critical for sustainable urban development. GeoTIFF’s geographic metadata facilitates detailed spatial analyses in GIS platforms, optimizing land use and planning.\nEnvironmental Monitoring and Conservation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgriculture Mapping, Crop & Plant Health   Source: dronesurveycanada.ca\nInformed by spectral resolution and EMR interactions, remote sensing precisely monitors ecosystem health, identifying vegetation types and assessing environmental changes. Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery, capturing extensive wavelength data, are essential for detailed environmental analyses.\nDisaster Response and Climate Change Tracking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAR Flood Map for 2017 Uruguay Flooding  Source: disasters.nasa.gov\nTemporal resolution’s importance is underscored in disaster management and climate change studies, where SAR imagery’s all-weather capability ensures continuous monitoring. This is vital for quick disaster response and understanding long-term environmental trends.\nNavigating Atmospheric Challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmospheric windows   Source: noaa.gov\nAddressing atmospheric absorption issues is crucial for uninterrupted Earth observation. Remote sensing techniques that penetrate atmospheric barriers enable consistent monitoring of the planet’s surface. For example: the places with limited or almost no absorption by the atmosphere is known as the atmospheric window, allowing us to peer into the atmosphere at various wavelengths."

Norwood advocated for a digital Multispectral Scanner (MSS), foreseeing its potential to capture both visible and invisible wavelengths, leading to the adoption of MSS as a standard for future remote sensing endeavors.\n\n\nData Corrections and Pre-processing\nEssential pre-processing steps necessary for remote sensing data usability. These corrections ensure the accuracy and reliability of the remote sensing data.\n\n\nRadiometric Calibration and Remote Sensing Jargon\nClarification of terms like Digital Number (DN), radiance, and reflectance, explaining the calibration process that converts DNs into meaningful spectral radiance values.\n\n\nAtmospheric Correction Types\nExplores atmospheric correction methods, distinguishing between relative and absolute approaches to adjust imagery for atmospheric influences. Techniques include Dark Object Subtraction (DOS), Psuedo-invariant Features (PIFs), and use of atmospheric radiative transfer models like MODTRAN and 6S. These corrections are pivotal for accurate earth surface representation, especially when deriving biophysical parameters or comparing data across time and space.\n\n\nOrthorectification and Topographic Correction\nFocuses on adjusting images for relief displacement caused by terrain, ensuring that imagery accurately represents the Earth’s surface as if viewed directly from above. Utilizes sensor geometry and elevation models, alongside cosine correction and other mathematical models, to correct for distortions.\n\n\nData Joining and Enhancement\nThe process involves mosaicking to create seamless imagery, with techniques like feathering and histogram matching to ensure consistency across images. Enhancements such as contrast adjustment, filtering, PCA, texture analysis, and fusion (e.g., pan-sharpening) are employed to improve image quality, interpretability, and application relevance. These techniques help in highlighting specific features, reducing data dimensionality, and integrating data from multiple sensors, thereby enhancing the utility of remote sensing imagery for various applications.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Remote Sensing Data Processing and Correction Formulas\n\nGeometric Correction Solution Model:\n\nNew x coordinate: \\(x = a_0 + a_1x_i + a_2y_i + \\epsilon_i\\)\nNew y coordinate: \\(y = b_0 + b_1x_i + b_2y_i + \\epsilon\\_i\\)\nThese formulas are used for transforming distorted image coordinates to more accurate positions, where (x_i, y_i) are the locations in the original image, and (a_0, a_1, a_2, b_0, b_1, b_2) are geometric transformation coefficients derived from Ground Control Points (GCPs).\n\nInverse Mapping Method (for Geometric Correction):\n\nOriginal x coordinate: \\(x_i = a_0 + a_1x + a_2y + \\epsilon\\_i\\)\nOriginal y coordinate: \\(y_i = b_0 + b_1x + b_2y + \\epsilon\\_i\\)\nThe inverse mapping method is used to deduce the original image’s location from the corrected image positions to ensure accurate pixel value mapping.\n\nRoot Mean Square Error (RMSE):\n\n\\(RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(observed - predicted)^2}{n}}\\)\nRMSE is used to evaluate the difference between model predictions and actual observations.

This formula is used for correcting the received radiance, especially when performing topographic correction.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Remote Sensing Data Analysis Formulas\n\nNormalized Burn Ratio (NBR):\n\n\\(NBR = \\frac{(NIR - SWIR)}{(NIR + SWIR)}\\)\nThis formula is used to detect burned areas or vegetation changes by comparing the reflectance between Near-Infrared (NIR) and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands.\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA):\n\nPCA is utilized to transform multispectral data into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables (principal components), often for dimensionality reduction and highlighting significant variables."

    "text": "3.2 Applications\nThis week’s practical content is very rich. This note will specifically document the Enhancements section of the practical, focusing on the Ratio and Texture aspects.\n\n3.2.1 Ratio: Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely used remote sensing index that serves as a key indicator for assessing the health, coverage, and condition of vegetation on the Earth’s surface. NDVI capitalizes on the distinct absorption and reflection properties of vegetation, particularly the contrast between the red (visible) and near-infrared (NIR) bands of sunlight. Active vegetation reflects more sunlight in the near-infrared band and absorbs more in the red band, making NDVI an ideal measure for gauging vegetation health (Zeng et al. 2022).\nThe values of NDVI range from -1 to 1, with higher values (closer to 1) indicating healthy, thriving vegetation, and lower values (closer to -1) suggesting bare soil or no vegetation cover, while values around 0 typically represent low vegetation cover or urbanized areas.\nIt’s calculated as follows: \\(NDVI = \\frac{(NIR - Red)}{(NIR + Red)}\\)\nThe image below shows the NDVI for Accra in Ghana using Landsat imagery from 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be noticed from the figure that the boundary between the city and the sea (water system) is not very clear… Additionally, the areas depicted in white, where the NDVI values are the lowest, have been identified through research as salt lake regions. This outcome is likely due to the high reflectance rates associated with these areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy extracting specific areas where the NDVI is equal to or greater than 0.2, the imagery reveals cities and water bodies in white, enhancing our ability to discern the distribution of vegetation. Additionally, it allows for the observation of a distinct difference in the NDVI values between the west (forested areas) and the east (farmlands), likely reflecting variations in vegetation density and health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial distribution of deterministic trends in seasonal photosynthetic activity across Canada and Alaska from 1982 through 2003   Source: (Goetz et al. 2005)\nThe study by Goetz et al. (2005) used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and other remote sensing data to estimate the biomass of forests in the Arctic region of Alaska and analyzed the impact of climate change on its distribution and variation. Through the analysis of long-term NDVI data, the research revealed a close correlation between forest biomass in the region and climate change, especially noting an increasing trend in forest biomass as regional temperatures rose. Additionally, the study highlighted the significant impact of fire disturbances on forest biomass, with NDVI data being able to monitor the patterns of forest recovery after fires. This research not only demonstrates the application value of NDVI in the science of global change but also emphasizes the importance of remote sensing technology in monitoring the impact of environmental changes on forest ecosystems.\n\n\n3.2.2 Texture: Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)\nTexture GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix) is a method used to analyze the texture of images. It characterizes the texture properties of an image by examining the spatial relationships of gray levels within it. GLCM is a statistical method that constructs a matrix by calculating the co-occurrence frequency of pixel pairs with specific gray levels at a certain distance and direction. This matrix reflects the distribution of different combinations of gray levels in the image, thereby describing its texture characteristics (Lan & Liu 2018).\nContinuing the analysis of textures in the Accra region, this step indeed consumed a significant amount of time… I’ve realized the significance of creating a study area polygon in QGIS~\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the color scale, dark green corresponds to higher values, indicating that regions of dark green in the image represent areas with a higher degree of texture homogeneity. These dark green areas suggest a consistent and uniform surface characteristic, which upon verification, are largely vegetation and water bodies. In contrast, areas in yellow signify lower homogeneity, pointing to more complex or varied surface features, often associated with urban built-up areas.\nOf particular interest is the ocean region in the lower right corner of the image, which also exhibits a heterogeneous texture, possibly influenced by the state of the sea surface. This suggests that for practical research, integrating GIS-related classification data for further analysis might be necessary to avoid potential misinterpretations."

    "text": "3.3 Reflection\nIntegrating remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) represents a new frontier in the field of image classification (Lu & Weng 2007). This integrated approach leverages the unique advantages of each system to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of classification, overcoming the limitations of using a single technology in addressing complex land cover classification challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have come across a paper by Lan & Liu (2018) which introduces a method that utilizes GIS and domain knowledge to determine multi-scale windows for GLCM texture descriptors, significantly improving the accuracy of high-resolution remote sensing image classification. The success of this method lies in its ability to extract geographic domain knowledge from different GIS information layers (such as topographic maps, Digital Elevation Models (DEM), land use maps, etc.) and the spatial data mining of this information, which in turn influences the selection of scale parameters for GLCM texture features. This insight profoundly impacted me: GIS and remote sensing technologies are not just tools for data collection and processing, but also serve as a bridge connecting data to the deeper relationships of geographic phenomena.\nThis realization led me to understand that to fully exploit the potential of remote sensing and GIS data, we must step beyond traditional thinking frameworks and adopt interdisciplinary approaches to problem-solving. For instance, combining remote sensing techniques with machine learning algorithms can significantly enhance the accuracy of classification and prediction; meanwhile, the spatial analysis capabilities of GIS can provide the necessary geographic context for these algorithms, helping us better understand and interpret model results. Furthermore, integrating domain knowledge not only enhances the accuracy of data analysis but also offers new perspectives for understanding complex geographic phenomena."

    "text": "4.1 Summary\n\n4.1.1 Background of Coastal Retreat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhana’s coastline, swallowed by the sea Source: The UNESCO Courier\nGhana’s coastline stretches over 550 kilometers and is crucial to the country’s socio-economic fabric, with significant activities like fishing, tourism, and industry. However, this coastal region faces severe erosion, with land receding at alarming rates due to natural processes exacerbated by human activities. Factors contributing to the erosion include rising sea levels linked to global warming, unchecked industrial activities, and infrastructure development. This has led to the loss of land, negatively impacting livelihoods, cultural heritage, and biodiversity.\nVideo: Erosion wearing down Ghana’s coast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Local Government Policy Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to these challenges, the Ghanaian government has developed and implemented policies aimed at mitigating coastal erosion. Ghana’s National Environmental Policy now mentions marine and coastal degradation as one of the country’s environmental challenges.The “Coastal Management Plan” focuses on constructing seawalls at critical points along the coast to protect against erosion. Moreover, the “National Urban Policy Framework - Ghana” discusses broader urban challenges, including coastal erosion, and emphasizes the socio-economic impacts and the importance of an integrated approach to urban management.\n\nPolicy Initiatives for Achieving Objective 4: Improve the Quality of the Urban Environment\n...\nFormulate and implement coastal management plans to achieve coastal revegetation and erosion control in degraded and neglected coastal towns.\nPolicy Initiatives for Achieving Objective 5: Ensure Effective Planning and Management of Urban Growth and Expansion\n...\nStrengthen the use of remote sensing (such as aerial photographs and satellite images) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to enhance urban development and management.\n\nThese initiatives underscore the government’s dedication to tackling coastal erosion by combining infrastructural interventions with sustainable management approaches.\n\n\n4.1.3 Alignment with United Nations SDGs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhana’s efforts to manage coastal erosion resonate with several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, these efforts align with Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) by enhancing urban sustainability and living conditions, Goal 13 (Climate Action) by addressing a significant effect of climate change, and Goal 14 (Life Below Water) by protecting marine ecosystems and biodiversity. These alignments underscore the multifaceted benefits of Ghana’s coastal management policies, extending beyond erosion mitigation to broader environmental and socio-economic improvements."

    "text": "4.2 Applications\n\n4.2.1 Accra as a Case Study in Coastal Erosion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastal erosion along portion of western Accra coast Source: Appeaning Addo et al. (2013)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthogonal transects for rates of change estimations Source: Appeaning Addo et al. (2008)\nNext, Accra was specifically chosen as a case study to explore regional dynamics. The Accra region confronts severe coastal erosion, with substantial land loss affecting livelihoods and infrastructure. From 2005 to 2017, about 37% of the coastal land succumbed to erosion and flooding. Combining local insights with scientific research has been pivotal in tackling this challenge, revealing an erosion rate of -0.91 m/year.\nWhile the Ghanaian government has implemented seawall constructions as a countermeasure, researchers stress the importance of adopting a more comprehensive approach beyond solely relying on structural defenses.\n\n\n4.2.2 Leveraging Remote Sensing for Coastal Management\nThe application of remotely sensed data can play a crucial role in supporting the policy goals set by the Ghanaian government for coastal erosion management. High-resolution optical satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, Gaofen-1), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (e.g., Sentinel-1), and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) such as ASTER GDEM and SRTM, offer valuable tools for monitoring, planning, and managing coastal erosion efforts effectively.\n· Monitoring and Assessment: By regularly comparing high-resolution satellite images, authorities can identify the most severely eroded areas and the rate of erosion. SAR data, capable of penetrating cloud cover, is invaluable for assessing the coastline’s status during and after storm events, providing crucial information for emergency response and recovery efforts (Dellepiane, De Laurentiis & Giordano 2004).\n· Planning and Implementation: DEMs offer a three-dimensional representation of the surface, aiding in understanding the erosion process and its impact on coastal landscapes. This information can be used to strategically plan the location and design of seawalls and other protective measures, ensuring they are both effective and environmentally sustainable (Evadzi, Zorita, & Hünicke 2017).\n· Public Engagement and Awareness: Visualizations created from remotely sensed data can enhance public awareness about coastal erosion. By making this information accessible, the government can foster community participation in coastal protection efforts, aligning with the policy’s emphasis on community involvement.\nUsing remote sensing technologies, Ghana can improve coastal resilience, make better decisions, respond faster, and adopt a proactive coastal management strategy. This also includes evaluating the success of seawall constructions, ensuring the effectiveness of coastal protection efforts."

    "text": "4.3 Reflection\nReflecting on my background as a landscape architecture student, my approach to addressing coastal erosion has traditionally focused on designing landscape features and interventions on a smaller scale to mitigate erosion and enhance the living environment for communities. This perspective emphasized the physical design and creation of spaces that directly interact with the coastal dynamics, such as dunes restoration, vegetation buffers, and community parks that double as protective barriers.\nNow, having learned about the capabilities of remote sensing, I see a broader scope of possibilities for contributing to coastal erosion management. Remote sensing allows for a macro-scale understanding of coastal dynamics, providing data that can inform not only the design of individual landscape projects but also larger, strategic planning efforts. It offers a way to monitor the effectiveness of landscape interventions over time and adapt strategies based on real-world feedback. This integration of technology and design can lead to more resilient and sustainable coastal landscapes.\nAs a landscape architecture student, the shift from a micro to a macro perspective, enabled by remote sensing, represents a significant expansion of the tools available to me. It opens up new avenues for collaboration with scientists, policymakers, and communities in the fight against coastal erosion. By combining design principles with cutting-edge technology, I can contribute to creating more effective, adaptive, and holistic solutions that address the root causes of coastal erosion while enhancing the quality of life for affected populations. This learning journey underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in tackling complex environmental challenges."

The temporal depth and spatial resolution of Landsat data allow for detailed tracking of urban growth over time. By analyzing satellite images from different years, researchers can identify patterns of urban sprawl, quantify the rate of expansion, and observe changes in land use. The graduating colors in the imagery provide a visual representation of outward expansion, making it easier to communicate the findings to policymakers and the public.\n\n\n6.1.2 Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-5 for Air Pollution Monitoring\nThe Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-5 satellites, part of the European Union’s Copernicus program, offer critical data for studying air pollution and its relation to land use/land cover changes. Sentinel-3 provides Sea and Land Surface Temperature data, which is essential for understanding heat distribution and its impact on air quality. Sentinel-5 Precursor, on the other hand, focuses on monitoring major air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide, ozone, formaldehyde, sulfur dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide, and aerosols. The integration of these datasets allows researchers to investigate the effects of LULC transformations on air pollution levels, providing insights into how urban planning and environmental policies might mitigate adverse impacts.\n\n\n6.1.3 Hexagonal Grid System for Data Integration\nThe concept of using a hexagonal grid system, as mentioned in the honeycombing technique, represents an innovative approach to integrating and analyzing sensor data from different sources. This method addresses the challenge of spatial heterogeneity in environmental data by providing a uniform framework for data aggregation. The hexagonal shape is preferred over square grids due to its efficiency in covering large areas without overlapping and minimizing distance distortion. This technique enhances the spatial analysis of environmental variables such as land surface temperature, particulate matter (PM2.5), and other pollutants, facilitating more accurate assessments of air quality and LULC impacts.\n\n\n6.1.4 Forest Watcher App for Illegal Logging Monitoring\nThe Forest Watcher app exemplifies the application of mobile technology in environmental conservation. It allows users, including law enforcement and environmental activists, to access Global Forest Watch data in the field, enabling the detection of deforestation and forest degradation in real time. This tool leverages high-resolution satellite imagery and algorithms to identify changes in forest cover. By making this information readily accessible on mobile devices, the app empowers local authorities and communities to take immediate action against illegal logging activities.\n\n\n6.1.5 Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Random Forests\nCART and random forests are powerful machine learning methods used for classification and regression tasks in environmental studies. CART algorithms split the data into subsets based on feature value thresholds, constructing decision trees that model the decision-making process. Random forests improve on this by creating an ensemble of decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data. This approach reduces the variance of the model, leading to more stable and accurate predictions. In environmental applications, these techniques can classify land cover types, predict pollution levels, or assess the risk of forest fires, among other uses."

The balance between recall and precision is evaluated using the F1-Score, which helps navigate the challenges of false positives and negatives. Additionally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) assess model performance by focusing on true positive rates and minimizing false positives. These techniques collectively offer a detailed framework for a more accurate and comprehensive evaluation of classification models."

This property of SAR allows for the precise identification of water bodies and flooded zones, essential for disaster response and environmental monitoring.\n\n\n\n8.1.2 SAR Fundamentals\n\nOperation: SAR systems emit electromagnetic signals to map earth’s surface by capturing backscatter, which varies with surface conditions and can see through weather and cloud cover.\nSynthetic Aperture: Through signal processing, SAR simulates a longer antenna, achieving higher resolution in imaging, which is crucial for detailed surface analysis and monitoring changes over time.\n\n\n\n8.1.3 SAR Polarization\n\nSurface Interaction: SAR polarization significantly influences how different surfaces are imaged, with VV polarization sensitive to surface roughness, VH or HV ideal for volume scattering (e.g., foliage), and HH polarization best for double-bounce surfaces (e.g., urban structures). This diversity in response aids in detailed environmental and urban studies.\n\n\n\n8.1.4 Change Detection with SAR\n\nDifferential Interferometry (DInSAR): Offers a method for tracking ground movements, vital for geological and infrastructure monitoring.\nData Fusion: Combining SAR with optical data enriches analysis, providing a multi-faceted view of environmental changes. The selection of the right scale (power, amplitude, dB) is crucial for accurate analysis and visualization, enhancing the interpretability of SAR data.\n\n\n\n8.1.5 Statistical Tests and Image Fusion\n\nStatistical Analysis: Application of t-tests and standard deviation to detect temporal changes in SAR data highlights SAR’s utility in change detection.\nImage Fusion Techniques: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis and Intensity Fusion are explored to merge SAR with optical data, offering comprehensive insights into environmental conditions and changes, thereby broadening the scope of remote sensing applications."
