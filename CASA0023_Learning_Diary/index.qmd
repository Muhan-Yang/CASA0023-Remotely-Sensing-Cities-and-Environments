# Hello, RS! {.unnumbered}

Welcome to my learning diary for CASA0023!

My name is Muhan Yang, and I hail from Anhui, China. I pursued my undergraduate studies in Landscape Architecture in Shanghai. Currently, I am a student at UCL's Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA).

I have a deep passion for music🎹🎻🎸 and share my home with an adorable Bichon Frise🐕.

I hold a keen interest in remote sensing technology and am currently engaged in actively exploring and learning more about this field...
