## Applications

### **Urbanization's Impact on Land Surface Temperature**

The study by Weng and Lu (2008) offers an insightful investigation into the effects of urbanization on land surface temperature (LST) in Indianapolis, USA. Utilizing Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery and a spectral unmixing model, the research quantitatively captures the morphological changes in urban landscapes and their impact on LST, revealing critical insights into the dynamics between increasing impervious surfaces, decreasing vegetation coverage, and the development of urban heat islands (UHIs).

**Methodology and Findings**

Employing linear spectral unmixing and hybrid classification methods, the study meticulously maps changes in **land use/land cover (LULC), impervious surfaces, and vegetation coverage over time**. It demonstrates a marked increase in impervious surfaces alongside a decrease in vegetation, correlating these changes with a rise in LST. Importantly, the study identifies a significant inverse relationship between LST and vegetation coverage, emphasizing the cooling effect of green spaces in urban areas.

**Significance for Urban Planning**

This research highlights the importance of integrating environmental considerations into urban planning efforts. By linking urbanization-driven LULC changes with increased LST, the study equips urban planners and policymakers with critical insights for creating more sustainable and livable urban environments. It underscores the necessity of preserving and incorporating green spaces within urban designs to mitigate UHI effects and enhance urban resilience to climate change.

### Urban Flood-Risk Assessment: Decision-Making and Machine Learning Integration

A groundbreaking approach to urban flood-risk assessment has been demonstrated by Taromideh et al. (2022), focusing on the city of Rasht, Iran. This study represents a significant advancement in utilizing semi-subjective and objective data through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and machine learning models. By integrating classification and regression tree models with decision-making frameworks, the research outlines a method for generating urban flood-risk maps that consider both vulnerability and hazard of different urban areas.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "igure5-01.png"))
```

**Technical Insights**:

-   **Machine Learning Application**: The study utilizes classification and regression tree models to analyze flood hazards and vulnerabilities. This methodological choice highlights the efficacy of machine learning in parsing complex environmental data, thereby enabling precise zoning of urban flood risks.

    ![](images/figure7.png)

-   **Data Integration**: Employing the AHP methodology, the study adeptly combines subjective judgments with objective assessments to organize and evaluate flood risk. This innovative approach underscores the importance of incorporating local knowledge and expert opinions into the analytical process, providing a more nuanced understanding of flood risks.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "figure8.png"))
```

-   **Practical Outcomes**: The resultant urban flood-risk map offers critical insights for city planners and emergency response teams in Rasht, illustrating areas of varying flood risk. Such detailed mapping is instrumental in guiding mitigation strategies, emergency responses, and urban planning decisions aimed at minimizing flood impact.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}

```

**Implications for Urban Planning**:

The study by Taromideh et al. (2022) not only provides a practical tool for flood-risk assessment in Rasht but also sets a precedent for other urban areas grappling with similar challenges. The integration of decision-making processes and machine learning into urban planning and risk management offers a promising pathway toward enhancing urban resilience against flooding.

## Reflection

Reflecting on my experiences from CASA0006, where I first delved into machine learning, I see how invaluable that foundational knowledge has been for my current foray into remote sensing applications. The leap from understanding basic machine learning concepts to applying them in the analysis of environmental data and satellite imagery has been both enlightening and empowering.

The ability to utilize techniques such as Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and random forests in the context of remote sensing has opened up new avenues for me to explore the complexities of our environment. It's fascinating to see the direct impact of these machine learning tools in interpreting vast datasets, monitoring urban growth, and assessing the health of our ecosystems from a bird's-eye view.

This journey has reinforced the idea that the skills and knowledge acquired in machine learning are not just theoretical but highly applicable in solving real-world environmental challenges. It's a vivid reminder of the importance of interdisciplinary learning and the need to stay curious and adaptable in a rapidly evolving field.
